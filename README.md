CS-305 Software Security


**#Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?**
Artemis Financial, which is a consulting company that specializes in financial planning. They reached out to my company, Gloabl Rain, for assisting them in modernizing their operations by improving the security of their web-based software applications. They were particularily focsed on addressing security vulnerabilties and ensuring that sensitive client data is fully protected. 

**#What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?**
During the vulnerability assessment, I excelled in identifying the security vulnerabilities in Artemis Financial's application. I utilized JAVA Eclipse and Maven to enhance the application's security. Additionally, I implemented the OWASP Dependency Check tool to generate an HTML report of known vulnerabilities and analyzed these vulnerabilities through the National Vulnerability Database. This approach allowed me to provide the client with a comprehensive understanding of their software's security posture.

Secure coding is important because it helps protect sensitive data, maintain trust with clients, and prevent financial losses and reputational damage. Software security adds value to a company's overall wellbeing by reducing the risk of data breaches and financial losses while enhancing customer confidence and compliance with regulatory requirements. 

**#What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?**
The most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was ensuring coverage of potential vulnerabilities and understanding hte specific intricacies of Artemis Financial's application, along with implementing a lot of the static check tools and making sure they ran properly. However, leveraging tools like the OWASP Dependency Check and the National Vulnerability Database provided highly beneficial in identifying an daddressing known vulnerabilities. 

**#How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?**
To enhance security, I recommended measures such as input validation, encryption, authentication improvements, and regular software patching. In the future, I would continue to use a combination of code analysis tools, penetration testing, and threat modeling to assess vulnerabilities and decide on mitigation techniques based on their severity and potential impact.

**#How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**
I ensured the code and software application were functional and secure through rigorous testing, including vulnerability scanning, code reviews, and security testing at various stages of development. After refactoring the code, I conducted regression testing and additional security testing to check for newly introduced vulnerabilities.

**#What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?**
In this assignment, I leveraged Java Eclipse, Maven, the OWASP Dependency Check tool, and the National Vulnerability Database to enhance security and produce actionable recommendations. These resources, tools, and practices can be invaluable for future assignments or tasks related to software security and vulnerability assessments.

**#Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?**
To showcase my skills and experience to future employers, I can provide evidence of my vulnerability assessment report for Artemis Financial, which includes the utilization of Java Eclipse, Maven, OWASP Dependency Check, and analysis through the National Vulnerability Database. This report demonstrates my expertise in software security, my commitment to protecting sensitive data, and my proficiency in utilizing industry-standard tools and practices to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities
